	<h3>History and Future</h3>

    <p>
        TableLayout is a well-tested and well-used layout manager. It has been around in one form or another
        since 1996. Over many years, TableLayout has been refined. It may now be as perfect as a layout manager
        can be. So it is unlikely that there will be subsequent version unless someone suggests a change that
        would significantly improve Tablelayout, and that change must be added to the core of TableLayout.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, ancillary support for TableLayout may be added to this site. Some suggestions have been to add
        TableLayout support to Netbeans, Forte, JBuilder, and other RAD tools. Since such ancillary "plug-ins"
        are not necessary to use TableLayout, and may be tool or JDK specific, they would be provided as
        extension jar files.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The main goal of the TableLayout project is to submit TableLayout to Sun for entry into JDK 1.6.

        The brief history of TableLayout is...

            <td>
                TableLayout was written to the JDK 1.0 and JDK 1.1 using custom classes for LinkedLists, etc.
                This version of TableLayout was never published, but was used by the author extensively.
                Most of the layout manager was written up front, but over time a few useful features were added.

            <td nowrap><i>2001</i></td>
            <td>
                TableLayout was modified to use only core Java classes from the JDK including the JDK 1.2 collections
                framework.  Non-standard classes were removed.  The API for TableLayout was modified to be more
                consistent with established Java conventions.<br><br>
                      
                The author contacted Sun and submitted the layout manager.  A Sun representative asked the author
                to write an article about TableLayout for The Swing Connection.  The article was submitted to Sun
                and reviewed along with the layout manager by several Sun architects.  TableLayout was further
                refined based on the feedback from Sun.  The article and TableLayout were published on Sun's
                website.  This was the first official version of TableLayout.

                The author received many positive messages from users across the world.  Some of the messages
                contained requests for features like justification for components occupying more than one cell.
                The requests that would most improve TableLayout were implemented.

            <td nowrap><i>2002</i></td>
            <td>
                An extension jar for TableLayout was created based on an idea from a developer to use the
                persistent delagation mechanism introduced in JDK 1.4 to save and load frames.

                components spanning multiple cells with absolute widths/heights.

                TableLayout now supports component orientation.  Two new justifcations have been added:
                LEADING and TRAILING.  Leading justification means components are left justified if
                their container is left-oriented and right justified if their container is right-oriented.
                Trailing justification is opposite.<br><br>

                Also, a constructor in the form <code>new TableLayout(double [] columns, double [] rows)</code>
                has been added for convenience.

                Fixed leak of XML Decoder in TableLayoutPersistenceDelegate class located in TableLayoutPersistenceDelegate.jar.<br>
                Fixed a javadoc comment for TableLayoutConstraints constructor.<br>
                Fixed a bug in getting the minimum size of a container that used preferred column/row sizes and getting
                the preferred size of a container that used minimum column/row sizes.

                Added convenience constructors to TableLayoutConstraints.  Fixed the sizes of cell spanning components
                that were not full justified.  They were getting extra space from gaps.

                TableLayout no longer flips container insets for right-to-left oriented containers since most java.awt
                layouts and Swing components do not (FlowLayout is the exception).   Minor performance tweak in
                the layoutContainer method.  Compatibility fix with old JDKs that did not support component orientation.

                TableLayoutConstraints constructor was setting <i>LEADING</i> justification to <i>FULL</i> due to an omission.

                Adjusted calculation for preferred and minimum sizes of a column/row to consider gaps that contribute to the size
                of a multicell component.  Updated license to be more compatible with most open source licenses.

                Added ComponentArranger builder for creating layouts.  Change access setting of insertCr from public to protected.
                Users should call insertColumn or insertRow instead.  Fixed many spelling errors in JavaDoc.  (Thanks to Eclipse
                for including a spellchecker!)
