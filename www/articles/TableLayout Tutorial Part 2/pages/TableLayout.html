                  TableLayout is a layout manager that provides all the power of GridBagLayout, but is simple and easy
                  to use.  TableLayout simplies the creation of graphical user interfaces by providing an intuitive and
                  powerful way to specify where components are placed and how they are resized.  TableLayout makes it
                  easy to write professional user interfaces quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TableLayout is a free layout manager.  You may use it in any commercial or non-commercial project.
                  There are no royalties or license fees.  You may subclass any class in the TableLayout package.
                  You may unjar or rejar the classes and source files as you wish.  The only restriction is that you
                  may not distribute modified versions of the TableLayout source.  This is to prevent confusion about
                  what TableLayout does and to give credit to the author.

                  is an extension of the clearthought.info.layout package that works with J2SE 1.4 and later.  This extension
                  allows frames and other containers to be persisted to an XML file using the persistence delegation
                  framework introduced in J2SE 1.4.  This extension is not necessary to use TableLayout, and the extension
                  will not work with older version of Java.

                  one cell, horizontal and vertical gaps, and some subtle behavioral changes.

                  On the World Wide Web there are many layout managers (some not even written in Java) that use the
                  name TableLayout.  This is not suprising since the name TableLayout is simple and descriptive.  These
                  classes were written by different people independently of each other.  To avoid confusion, the layout
                  manager on this page may be refered to as Clearthought's TableLayout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clearthought's TableLayout appears on many websites around the world.  Sometimes the package name
                  has been changed to an organization's package name like org.XYZ.layout.  This is fine.  However,
                  if you have a version of TableLayout whose package is not info.clearthought.layout, you might not
                  have an official or latest version.  You can obtain the latest, official version from this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, at the time the author wrote the article on Sun's website, he did not possess a domain
                  name.  So the version of TableLayout on the article simply used the package name "layout" with no other
                  designation.  If the version of TableLayout you are using has this package name, it is not the
                  latest version, and you should upgrade to the version on this site.

                  TableLayout is a well-tested and well-used layout manager.  It has been around in one form or
                  another since 1996.  Over many years, TableLayout has been refined.  It may now be as perfect
                  as a layout manager can be.  So it is unlikely that there will be subsequent version unless
                  someone suggests a change that would significantly improve Tablelayout, and that change must
                  be added to the core of TableLayout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, ancillary support for TableLayout may be added to this site.  Some suggestions have
                  been to add TableLayout support to Netbeans, Forte, JBuilder, and other RAD tools.  Since
                  such ancillary "plug-ins" are not necessary to use TableLayout, and may be tool or JDK
                  specific, they would be provided as extension jar files.

                      TableLayout was written to the JDK 1.0 and JDK 1.1 using custom classes for LinkedLists, etc.
                      This version of TableLayout was never published, but was used by the author extensively.
                      Most of the layout manager was written up front, but over time a few useful features were added.

                      TableLayout was modified to use only core Java classes from the JDK including the JDK 1.2 collections
                      framework.  Non-standard classes were removed.  The API for TableLayout was modified to be more
                      consistent with established Java conventions.<br><br>
                      
                      The author contacted Sun and submitted the layout manager.  A Sun representative asked the author
                      to write an article about TableLayout for The Swing Connection.  The article was submitted to Sun
                      and reviewed along with the layout manager by several Sun architects.  TableLayout was further
                      refined based on the feedback from Sun.  The article and TableLayout were published on Sun's
                      website.  This was the first official version of TableLayout.

                      LEADING and TRAILING.  Leading justification means components are left justified if
                      their container is left-oriented and right justified if their container is right-oriented.
                      Trailing justification is opposite.<br><br>

                      Also, a constructor in the form <code>new TableLayout(double [] columns, double [] rows)</code>
                      has been added for convenience.

                  There is a strong tendancy for people to associate TableLayout with the HTML table element.
                  TableLayout was written in Java to the Java layout manager specification.  When people think of
                  Java, they tend to think of the Web.  When they think of the Web, they think of HTML, and HTML
                  has a table element that uses rows and columns and elements that span columns.  Following this
                  stream of thought, some people make analogies of TableLayout to HTML tables.  This is bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                  HTML tables are great constructs for structuring web pages.  However, HTML tables are nothing
                  like TableLayout.  Essentially, HTML tables are not truly tables.  They are rows of columns.
                  Each column can contain a different number of rows.  Elements can span rows and columns, but the
                  behavior varies between browsers, especially when nesting such tables.  Also,
                  rows are declared first as outer elements, and columns are declared inside each row.  This makes
                  HTML tables very row-centric.

                  The idea for TableLayout came from spreadsheets, not HTML tables.  TableLayout does follow the
                  spreadsheet (and word-processor) concepts much more closely than it follows the ideas used by
                  HTML tables.  Essentially, TableLayout divides a container into a table where each row and each
                  column can be independently resized just like a spreadsheet does.  Rows and columns are both
                  first-class citizens.  Anything that can be said about a row can also be said about a columns
                  and vice-versa.

                  The justification used by TableLayout was based on word-processor justification.  Horizontally,
                  paragraphs can have one of four justifications: left, center, right, and full.  Vertically, the
                  contents of a page can be justified one of three ways: top, center, bottom.  TableLayout added
                  the idea of full justification in the vertical.

                  Some users have indicated a preference for using a (row, column) specification of cells instead
                  of (column, row).  For some this desire comes from being use to referring to Matix entries or
                  array entries in a (row, column) fasion.  The reason TableLayout uses (column, row) is two fold.
                  First, TableLayout was based on the ideas behind spreadsheets, and spreadsheets specify cells
                  as (column, row).  For example, cell B7 is in the second column (B) and the seventh row.  The
                  second reason is that using the (column, row) convention is similiar to using (x, y) or
                  (x1, y1, x2, y2).  You can think of add(c, "1, 10, 3, 20") as "add c to coordinates (1, 10)
                  through (3, 20)" where coordinates are following an (x, y) convention.
