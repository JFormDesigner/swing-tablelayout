          Great job on the layout! I love it. I am blown away how easy it is to use. It is 
          by far much better than any of the other layouts. The only one I will use is CardLayout for a wizard 
          component I wrote. But other than that, this is now my only layout I use! I think you should seriously 
          consider submitting it to Sun to get included in the next version of Java, if not a 1.4 update, maybe 1.5. 
          It is, as you showed, much easier to use than both GridLayout and GridBagLayout.

          I wanted to personally thank you for the excellent TableLayout.
          It is exactly in the sweet spot between simplicity and power.
          Before TableLayout I was layering panels in BorderLayouts like you 
          wouldn't believe!  I had to write the UIs in one sitting because I could 
          never go back and make a change!
          I tried creating UIs with every release of JBuilder from latte to version 
          6.  Every time I went back to SlickEdit (although I've now switched to 
          IntelliJ Idea)
          And I tried coding GridBagLayout by hand.  That didn't even come out 
          looking like the the Java I know.
          So, I just stayed away from writing UI code.
          Finally, with TableLayout, I can sculpt the UI as I go along.

          My compliments on your article about table layout and the code, found on
          the Swing connection.<br><br>
          
          A longtime 'command line' DOS programmer, I am trying to teach myself Java
          which I admire greatly but find GUI coding terrible. I quickly found out
          how to use this layout and have already used it in an in house application.
          I hope the Swing team will integrate this in their next offering.
          No reply required -- just thanks for your work.

          It is the best layout to date. Lots of people literally suffering working

          I read your article about your TableLayout manager that is posted on the 
          Sun web site.  I want to tell you that I think your layout manager is the 
          easiest to use of all of the layout manager classes that I have 
          implemented.  I have primarily been working with the GridBagLayout manager 
          for all of my Swing projects.  It was very frustrating trying to get the 
          UIs to size without any of the pixel problems that you point out in your 
          article.  Thanks again for such a great layout manager class.

          TableLayout is very useful and makes it a lot easier to develop Swing 
          applications. In fact, the existing knowledge on spreadsheets and HTML 
          tables enables developers to create frames and dialogs much more 
          efficiently. Thanks for this excellent invention!

          I wanted to say thanks for the layout!  As many of the other quotes from
          your web-site attest, it's a great contribution.  I don't abhor laying out
          my GUI screens anymore, I just sketch them on paper and lay them out in

          You have significantly improved the layout situation in Swing applications.
          It is not only that you've inspired me, but I have used your TableLayout in
          Swing courses and have found that its mental model is what developers can
          understand quickly.
